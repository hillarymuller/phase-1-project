Outfit Inspiration

I often find myself in need of inspiration for how to put together the items in my closet to make new, fun outfits, so I built a page with some fresh looks! I took a couple months off from coding while going through some major life changes that will allow me to focus on Flatiron full-time, so my goal for this project was to keep it incredibly simple and fun! 

My end goal is to be able to create an app like Cher's computer closet from Clueless, seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU.

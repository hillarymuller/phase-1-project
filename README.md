Outfit Inspiration

I often find myself in need of inspiration for how to put together the items in my closet to make new, fun outfits, so I built a page with some fresh looks! I took a couple months off from coding while going through some major life changes that will allow me to focus on Flatiron full-time, so my goal for this project was to keep it simple and fun! 

My end goal is to be able to create an app like Cher's computer closet from Clueless, seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU. For now, the project simply shows some outfit options that can be favorited.

Features:
- Images load from db.json when DOM content has loaded.
- When the mouse enters a category, that entire category's background changes. When the mouse leaves, the background returns to white.
- When the user clicks on the heart button, the heart is filled in.
